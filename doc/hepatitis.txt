hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. acute hepatitis can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to its, or rarely result in acute liver failure. over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer.
the most common cause worldwide is viruses. other causes of hepatitis include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash). there are five main types of viral hepatitis: type a, b, c, d, and e . hepatitis b is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. both hepatitis b and c are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. hepatitis d can only infect people already infected with b .
hepatitis a, b, and d are preventable with immunization. medications may be used to treat chronic cases of viral hepatitis. there is no specific treatment for nash; however, a healthy lifestyle, including physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight loss, is important. autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. a liver transplant may also be an option in certain cases.
