what is HIV?
the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).

without treatment, average survival time after infection with hiv is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the hiv subtype.



///what is HIV aids?
HIV aids is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



what is the average survival time without treatment if affected by HIV?
without treatment, average survival time after infection with hiv is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the hiv subtype.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



///how hiv transmitted from one person to another? 
in most cases, hiv is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



how hiv transmission on non-sexually?
non-sexual transmission of hiv can occur from an infected mother to her infant through breast milk.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



how hiv transmit from mother to child?
an hiv-positive mother can transmit hiv to her baby both during pregnancy and childbirth due to exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).


how hiv present in body fluids in the form of?
within these bodily fluids, hiv is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



/////where do hiv viruses infections? 
hiv infection vital cells in the human immune system such as helper t cells (specifically cd4+ t cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells.

hiv infection leads to low levels of cd4+ t cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected t cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected cd4+ t cells by cd8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.



how hiv infections leads to?
hiv infection leads to low levels of cd4+ t cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected t cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected cd4+ t cells by cd8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).



///how HIV aids develop inside the body?
when cd4+ t cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of aids.

the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes hiv infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).
